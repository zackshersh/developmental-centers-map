Children who did not speak English as their native language were also sometimes dumped here, many of these people could take care of themselves and only needed help from parents however due to social stigmas in the 60's many of these people where dumped in these facilities. In 1974 twenty perfectly functional orphans were also sent to Forest Haven purley because the orphanage they were housed in had closed. Forest haven was not just overcrowded but also understaffed, with up to 100 open positions, these positions were not filled mostly due to a lack of funds and inability to pay a large number of staff.:Like many other institutions throughout the country Forest Havens problems came from stigmitization of mental disabilities (wich led to many people dumping their disabled children and overcrowding at these institutions) and decades of state budget cuts (wich led to these institutons not being able to hire addaquite staff or even make needed repairs to buildings).\n\nFollowing worsening conditions and a barrarage of abuse allegations, in 1978 a civil lawsuit was filed by parents of many children at forest haven, this massive lawsuit eventualy led to many patients being transfered to group homes in the area, where they were able to recive more attentative care.",

    "__16": "The Florida State Hospital, established in 1876, is located at Chattahoochee in the panhandle of Northwest Florida. It is on the site of an old United States Arsenal, which was built in 1834, just below the junction of the Flint and the Chattahoochee River, to command the ships on the Apalachicola River.\n\nFlorida State Hospital was originally a Federal Arsenal, built by the U.S. Army to be used as an arms depot during the second Seminole Indian War. It was used by the Freedman's Bureau from 1865 to 1868, and then served as the state's first penitentiary. Two of the original buildings still remain; the Officer's Quarters, which now serves as the Florida State Hospital Administration Building, and a Powder Magazine, which is currently being restored for eventual use as a museum and conference center.\n\nThe facility remained Florida's only state mental institution until 1947 and continues today to be the largest of a statewide system of treatment centers for individuals with mental and physical disabilities. It is listed on the National Historic Registry.",

These \"patients\" were diagnosed as having a pathological dysfunction, were treated through training, and then were \"paroled,\" like prisoners. These paroled patients would need constant follow-up care and occasionally returned to the institution when their disability manifested itself again in misbehavior. Hawaiians, Part-Hawaiians, Puerto Ricans and Portuguese were admitted in much higher proportions than their populations within in the community. Females, notably young adult females, were also admitted in higher proportions. In Hawaii, there were three unsuccessful attempts to create sterilization legislation (1933, 1935, and 1953).",

Patients were transferred to other institutions, and the land and buildings to Olmsted County. In 1857 a new wing was added to the Monroe County (N.Y.) Alms House specifically for care of the mentally disabled. Known thenceforth as the Monroe County Insane Asylum, the faculty was moved to a separate building in 1862. In 1890, the New York State Legislature passed legislation to establish a state-wide system of psychiatric hospitals. In those counties where asylums already existed, the State offered to purchase asylums and continue their operation under State administration and funding. Monroe County accepted this offer, and on July 1, 1891, the Monroe County Insane Asylum became the Rochester State Hospital. Early in the 1970s, the hospital became the Rochester Psychiatric Center, under which name it continues to operate.",

    "__16": "Prior to 1869, Montana Territory made no special provisions for mental patients, their care generally being left to regular hospitals. The Helena Weekly Herald in a September 19, 1867, article on the county hospital commented on the need for a territorial insane asylum, stating that the county hospital was not the proper place for a \"lunatic.\"\n\nTwo years later the 6th Territorial Legislative Assembly passed a law authorizing an official territorial insane asylum to be owned and managed on a contract basis by private parties. A board of commissioners was established with one representative from each judicial district to oversee the asylum, establish rules for its operation, and perform periodic inspections. Until 1877 St. John's Hospital in Helena served as the territorial asylum. By 1874 it was accepting sufficient numbers of patients committed by Governor Benjamin Potts to require the construction of a separate building behind the main hospital.\n\nIn 1877 Drs. Armistead H. Mitchell (1831-1898) and Charles F. Mussigbrod (d.1893), owners of a hotel and spa at Warm Springs, Montana, were awarded the contract for the care of the territory's mental patients. By 1886 the partners had expanded their operation from 160 acres to 1640 acres and from two buildings to thirty-two buildings, including a larger hotel, a house for convalescents, a separate building for violent patients, a large plunge pool, a laundry, storehouses, icehouses, and many other outbuildings. From 1891 to 1907 the hospital was run by Dr. O.Y. Warren, who was in turn succeeded by Dr. J.M. Scanland, son-in-law of Dr. Mitchell. Under private operation, the asylum continued to operate the hotel and run a large farm, specializing in pedigreed cattle.\n\nGradually under state operation the emphasis changed from a custodial asylum to a hospital, as more modern procedures were adopted, but efforts were hampered by low funding. Care costs in 1938 of $.60 per day per patient were the lowest in the nation. As concepts of treatment of mental patients changed, the average patient load dropped dramatically from a high of over 1900 in the early 1950s to 1112 in 1972. Numbers of admissions per year were higher, but average length of stay was much shorter.",

The main objective of the farm was that the hospital be able to feed itself. In 1905 a post office named Ingleside was established on the grounds. The hospital superintendents were postmasters until 1913 when Percy Jones became the first civil service postmaster. The post office closed in 1972. From 1905 until 1972 the institution was commonly called Ingleside, the name of the post office.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, a tuberculosis ward was located at the hospital. The early 1920s saw the first attempt at treatment of the mentally ill. Electro-shock treatment, which produced convulsions in the patient was begun. In the 1930s and 1940s, fever therapy, hydro-therapy and insulin shock therapy were begun. In the 1920s a dentist was hired. Prior to that inmates dental problems were simply ignored. Early in the 1950s the biggest beak-through in treatment came with the discovery of psychiatric drugs, which included tranquilizers. From that time on it was possible to unlock wards and start a program of rehabilitation of the inmate. Such services as occupational therapy, industrial therapy, recreational therapy, religious therapy, vocational therapy, psycho-therapy, reality therapy, transactional analysis and behavior modification were added.",

The village was designed to be a self-sustaining agrarian community, where epileptics could live together in a wholesome environment, learn trades, receive medical treatment, and leave behind the almshouses, insane asylums and even prisons to which they had been consigned in the past.â \n\nBy 1949, the State Department of Health initiated efforts to reduce the number of epileptics at the village. They opened clinics around the state for epileptics whose seizures could be medically controlled. Only the severe cases were brought to the village for evaluation and treatment\n\n\nThe New Jersey Neuro-Psychiatric Institute was established in 1953, having formerly been the State Village for Epileptics. In 1983, it became North Princeton Developmental Center.",

This institution also began to admit people with intellectual disabilities in 1935. Eventually known as Craig Developmental Center, it closed on December 6, 1988.\n\nCraig Colony, named after Dr. Oscar Craig of Rochester, N.Y., was the second institution specifically for epileptics in the United States. At the time of the opening of Craig, it was believed that the inmates would be able to âsenseâ an oncoming seizure in the other patients, and would be able to prevent injuries due to falls. Craig, like the other institutions had a working farm, craft shops, school, and hospitals.\n\nIn 1968, the facility was phased out of existence as a specialized institution and became a facility for care, treatment, education, and training for people with intellectual and other developmental disabilities. In 1974, it was re-named a Developmental Center and operated under the authority of the New York State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities before closing in 1988.",

Prior to the New York Department of Mental Hygieneâs acquisition of the property in 1926, it consisted of three separate farms. The operation was established to alleviate overcrowding at other facilities in New York City and Long Island. Within three years of acquiring the land 27 buildings were already nearing completion.\n\nIn the mid-1940s, additional security measures, including the installation of window guards and a new wall, were introduced in an attempt to deal with patients who were considered a high risk for flight. Still, overcrowding plagued many of the state-operated sites and by the 1950s, Wassaic State School reached its peak, housing up to 5,000 patients. In 1965, the Willowbrook State School on Staten Island stimulated scandalous newspaper headlines when an investigation found that it exceeded its capacity by about 2,000 residents, and those living there did so in filth and clad in dirty clothing. The scandal, which was broadcast nationwide, caused state officials to closely examine all the facilities.\n\nThe Wassaic operation subsequently went through two name changes through the years, first to the Wassaic Developmental Center and later to the Taconic Developmental Disabilities Service Office (DDSO). The facility closed in late 2013 in order to integrate individuals with developmental disabilities into the community. While residents are now gone from the facility, a support staff still works at the developmental disabilities service office building, located in the center of the complex.",

This led to a highly controversial medical study being conducted there between 1963 and 1966, in which healthy children were intentionally injected with the virus that causes the disease. These studies were designed to gain an understanding of the natural history of infectious hepatitis and subsequently to test the effects of gamma globulin in preventing or combating the disease.\n\nThe subjects, all children, were deliberately infected with the hepatitis virus; early subjects were fed extracts of stools from infected individuals and later subjects received injections of more purified virus preparations. Investigators defended the deliberate injection of these children by pointing out that the vast majority of them acquired the infection anyway while at Willowbrook, and perhaps it would be better for them to be infected under carefully controlled research conditions.\n\nThrough the several decades that Willowbrook was opened, there were continuous allegations of abuse reported on by the local paper, The Staten Island Advance. For many years, these allegations were dismissed and Willowbrook continued to uphold its well-respected reputation in the community. However by early 1972, Geraldo Rivera, then a reporter for television station WABC in New York, conducted a series of investigations at Willowbrook (on the heels of a previous series of articles in the Staten Island Advance and Staten Island Register newspapers), uncovering a host of deplorable conditions, including overcrowding, inadequate sanitary facilities, and physical abuse of residents by members of the school's staff. This resulted in a class-action lawsuit being filed against the State of New York in federal court on March 17, 1972. A settlement in the case was reached on May 5, 1975, mandating reforms at the site, but several years would elapse before all of the violations were corrected. The publicity generated by the case was a major contributing factor to the passage of a federal law, called the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act of 1980.",
    "__17": "Willowbrook State School, a state-run school for children with intellectual disability on Staten Island whose atrocities and abuses were exposed to the world in 1972 by TV news journalist Geraldo Rivera, was closed in 1987. New York's Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities (OMRDD) held a âlandmark eventâ November 13, 2007 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of closing Willowbrook, outlining events related to Willowbrook.",
